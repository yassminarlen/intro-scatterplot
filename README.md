# Defining Scatterplot
**Scatter Plots are graphs that describe the relationship between two numerical variables.** 
1. The scatterplot has two axes and is meant to show the correlation between variables.
2. The variables on a scatter plot could be associated/dependent with each other, which means there is a connection/relationship between the variables. 
3. Variables could be positively or negatively associated with each other. 
4. Positively associated variables increase synchronously. 
5. Negatively associated variables, when one variable increases the other decreases.
